This uses the same symbols from the ``omni.asset_validator`` open framework and API but applied in the context of Omniverse. These are imported into the new ``omni.asset_validator.core`` namespace. Use the appropriate extension or libraries depending on development needs.


It includes the following components:

- A **rule interface** and **registration mechanism** that can be called from external python modules.
- An **engine** that runs the rules on a given `Usd.Stage`, USD layer USD files, or recursively searches a folder for USD layers.
- An **issue fixing** interface for applying automated fixes if/when individual rules provide suggestions.
