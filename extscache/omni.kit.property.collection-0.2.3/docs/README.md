## Introduction

Collections are a way to group/organise prims and properties in USD. They are a set of properties which can be crated under any prim in the scene. Collections can be included in other collections (recursively)
Prims can be explicitly included in a collection (or excluded from it). Setting the appropriate expansion rule brings in their children (recursively) and their properties. Anything included can also be excluded.

## This extension
