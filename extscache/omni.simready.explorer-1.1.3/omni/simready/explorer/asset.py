    An asset type derived from SimreadyAsset is expected to be of one of these types.
    The AssetType values are used when registering a new asset type with the AssetFactory,
    using the AssetFactory.register() decorator. The asset class should also set its _type
    attribute to the same AssetType value it registered itself with.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

    SimreadyAsset is an abstract type that implements the common behavior of all SimReady assets.
    Derived classes can further refine and customize the semantics of a Simready asset.

    A SimReady asset is a collection of sublayers and other data files usually grouped in a folder.
    The SimReady Specification <todo: add link> defines the structure of a SimReady asset in detail.
    At a high level, a SimReady asset is comprised of:

    * Main file : {asset_name}.usd
    * Sublayers : {asset_name}_{description}.usd
    * Materials: all mdl or usd material data
    * Textures: all image data pertaining to materials
    * Thumbnails: thumbnail images of the asset

    SimReady assets expose a number of behaviors such as physics, appearance, etc.
    Assets can also have behaviors that are specific to their type. For example, vehicles
    may have the number of wheels and doors as part of their behavior.

    SimReady assets can be tagged. Tags are space delimited groups of words used in
    filtering assets in an asset library.

    SimReady assets can be labeled. Hierarchical labels can come from the Wiki Data database (https://www.wikidata.org)
    and are backed by a QCode. The SimReady Explorer displays the labels in the `Category Tree Window`.
    Labels, just like tags can be multi-word, and can be used to search for assets.

        The SimReady Explorer API does not fully support yet asset classes created by 3rd party developers.
